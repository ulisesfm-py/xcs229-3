{\bf Coding Submission:}
Some questions in this assignment require a coding response.  For these questions, you should submit only the |src/submission.py| file in the online student portal.  Your code will be
autograded online using |src/grader.py|, which is provided for you in the |src/|
subdirectory. You can also run this autograder on your local computer, although some of the tests will be skipped (since they
require the instructor solution code for comparison).
