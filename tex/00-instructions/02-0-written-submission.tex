{\bf Written Submission:}
All students must submit an electronic PDF containing solutions to the written
questions. As long as the submission is legible and well-organized, the course
staff has no preference between a handwritten and a typeset \LaTeX submission.
Students wishing to typeset their documents should follow these recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Type responses only in |submission.tex|.
  \item If you choose to submit a typeset document, please submit the compiled
  PDF, {\bf not} |submission.tex|.
  \item Use the commented recommendations within the Makefile and README.md to
  get started.
\end{itemize}
